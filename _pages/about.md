I am an undergraduate senior at Bowdoin College majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests include computer vision, computational imaging, natural language processing, and machine learning. 

My recent work includes medical image reconstruction using supervised learning for accelerated MRI scans, developing Convolutional Nearest Neighbor (ConvNN) operators that replace fixed-grid convolution with adaptive k-NN sampling for global context aggregation in neural networks.
