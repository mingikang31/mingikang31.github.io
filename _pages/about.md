I am an undergraduate senior at Bowdoin College majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests include computer vision, computational imaging, machine learning, and natural language processing. I am passionate about developing algorithms and model architecture for deep learning with efficiency and interpretability in mind.

My recent work includes medical image reconstruction using supervised learning for accelerated MRI scans, developing Convolutional Nearest Neighbor (ConvNN) operators that replace fixed-grid convolution with adaptive k-NN sampling for global context aggregation in neural networks, and researching a novel activation function for deep learning models.  

Besides research, I enjoy snowboarding, playing basketball, exploring new cafes, and cooking. I have an older sister at USC Keck School of Medicine. I am a huge fan of the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Boston Celtics. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect!
